  <li>Loads full HTTP requests associated with Assess vulnerabilities, including path parameters, methods, and request bodies.</li>
  <li><strong>Live Browsing</strong>: Adds a correlation ID to proxied requests so that Assess can push detected vulnerabilities into Burp's Issues tab in near real-time.</li>
  <li>Supports API-based authentication via YAML credentials file.</li>

  <li>Respects Burp Suite's upstream and SOCKS proxy settings.</li>
